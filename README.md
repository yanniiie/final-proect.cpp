Hospital Appointment Scheduler

Description: The Hospital Appointment Scheduler is a software application designed to manage appointments at a hospital or clinic. It provides functionalities for scheduling, updating, and canceling appointments for patients. Users can create new appointments, view existing appointments, modify appointment details, and remove appointments as needed.

Objectives:

Efficient Appointment Management: The system aims to efficiently handle appointment scheduling, allowing users to add, update, and delete appointments seamlessly.
Persistent Storage: Implement mechanisms to save appointment data to a file and load it from a file, ensuring data persistence across multiple sessions.
User-Friendly Interface: The application provides a simple and intuitive command-line interface for users to interact with the system effectively.
Error Handling: Gracefully handle common errors such as invalid input or attempting to modify non-existent appointments.
Design Decisions:

Data Storage: Appointments are stored in a vector to facilitate dynamic resizing and efficient iteration.
Appointment Representation: A struct is used to encapsulate appointment details such as patient name, appointment date, and doctor's name.
File I/O: The system supports saving appointment data to a file and loading it from a file using standard file stream operations.
User Interface: Interaction with the system occurs through a command-line interface, allowing users to input commands and view appointment details easily.
Algorithms and Data Structures:

Data Structure: A vector is utilized to store the collection of appointments.
Struct Appointment defines the attributes of an appointment, such as patient name, appointment date, and doctor's name.
Algorithms:

Add Appointment: Appends a new appointment to the appointments vector.
Update Appointment: Iterates through the appointments vector to find an appointment by its index and updates its details.
Remove Appointment: Iterates through the appointments vector to find an appointment by its index and removes it.
Display Appointments: Iterates through the appointments vector and prints each appointment's details.
Save to File: Writes each appointment's details to a file, one appointment per line.
Load from File: Reads each line from a file, parses the appointment details, and adds the appointment to the appointments vector.
